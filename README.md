# VaryLaTeX

It's a complete rewrite/extension of https://github.com/FAMILIAR-project/varylatex

To initiate the work, we build upon the implementation described on this blog post [LaTeX writing as a constrained non-convex optimization problem](https://blog.martisak.se/2020/06/06/latex-optimizer/) and available on gitlab: https://gitlab.com/martisak/latex-optimizer/ 
(note: "fork" of gitlab as described here: http://ruby.zigzo.com/2015/03/23/moving-from-gitlab-to-github/) 

To run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python optimizer.py
```

To learn about the implementation in terms of LaTeX macros, see [about.md](docs/about.md)
