In this paper, we provided evidence that product lines can jeopardize their trade secrets. 
% Other product lines (\eg in the domain of video games~\cite{videogames}) are certainly subject 
 % Our vision is that it is urgent to cross-fertilize the research results in software product lines and security. 
% The trend to exhibit product lines on the Web certainly explains why the problem has not been considered so far.

 Any software systems may come up against security/protection issues, yet the specificities of handling variability/configurations raise novel and difficult challenges. 
 % We identified several research directions for protecting the internal software variability and configurations of product lines.
We mainly took the perspective of a defender; the research can be considered from an attacker point of view as well (though ethics and legal aspects have to be defined). 
% The major challenge is to determine when the trade secrets of a product line outweigh investments required to develop and deploy adequate protecting mechanisms. 
 For concluding, we formulate the idea that software variability of product lines, as a key competing advantage and first-class citizen, should itself vary to complicate the task of an external attacker. % suggest?
