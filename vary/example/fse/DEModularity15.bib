  abstract = {With around two decades of existence, the community of Software Product Line (SPL) researchers and practitioners is thriving as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of engineers to build highly complex SPLs. Yet, it is unclear how SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, or what is the material available. In this paper, we carry out a survey with over 30 respondents with the purpose of capturing a snapshot of the state of teaching in our community. We report and discuss quantitative as well as qualitative results of the survey. We build upon them and sketch six concrete actions to continue improving the state of practice of SPL teaching.},

In software product line (SPL) engineering, a software configuration can be obtained through a valid selection of features represented in a feature model (FM).
With a strong separation between requirements and reusable components and a deep impact of high level choices on technical parts, determining and configuring an well-adapted software configuration is a long, cumbersome and error-prone activity.
This paper presents a modeling process in which variability sources are separated in different FMs and inter-related by propositional constraints while consistency checking and propagation of variability choices are automated.
We show how the variability requirements can be expressed and then refined at design time so that the set of valid software configurations to be considered at runtime may be highly reduced. Software tools support the approach and some experimentations on a video surveillance SPL are also reported.

    abstract = {{Feature Models (FMs) are a popular formalism for modeling and reasoning about the configurations of a software product line. As the manual construction or management of an FM is time-consuming and error-prone for large software projects, recent works have focused on automated operations for reverse engineering or refactoring FMs from a set of configurations/dependencies. Without prior knowledge, meaningless ontological relations (as defined by the feature hierarchy and groups) are likely to be synthesized and cause severe difficulties when reading, maintaining or exploiting the resulting FM. In this paper we define a generic, ontological-aware synthesis procedure that guides users when identifying the likely siblings or parent candidates for a given feature. We develop and evaluate a series of heuristics for clustering/weighting the logical, syntactic and semantic relationships between features. Empirical experiments on hundreds of FMs, coming from the SPLOT repository and Wikipedia, show that an hybrid approach mixing logical and ontological techniques outperforms state-of-the-art solutions and offers the best support for reducing the number of features a user has to consider during the interactive selection of a hierarchy.}},

The size and complexity of these models is partly explained by the large number of concerns considered by SPL practitioners when managing and configuring FMs. In this chapter, we first survey concerns and their separation in FMs, highlighting the need for more modular and scalable techniques. We then revisit the concept of view as a simplified representation of an FM. We finally describe a set of techniques to specify, visualize and verify the coverage of a set of views. These techniques are implemented in complementary tools providing practical support for feature-based configuration and large scale management of FMs. },

  abstract = { Variability management is a key issue when building and evolving software-intensive systems, making it possible to extend, configure, customize and adapt such systems to customers' needs and specific deployment contexts. A wide form of variability can be found in extensible software systems, typically built on top of plugin-based architectures that offer a (large) number of configuration options through plugins. In an ideal world, a software architect should be able to generate a system variant on-demand, corresponding to a particular assembly of plugins. To this end, the variation points and constraints between architectural elements should be properly modeled and maintained over time (i.e., for each version of an architecture). A crucial, yet error-prone and time-consuming, task for a software architect is to build an accurate representation of the variability of an architecture, in order to prevent unsafe architectural variants and reach the highest possible level of flexibility. In this article, we propose a reverse engineering process for producing a variability model (i.e., a feature model) of a plugin-based architecture. We develop automated techniques to extract and combine different variability descriptions, including a hierarchical software architecture model, a plugin dependency model and the software architect knowledge.  By computing and reasoning about differences between versions of architectural feature models, software architect can control both the variability extraction and evolution processes. The proposed approach has been applied to a representative, large-scale plugin-based system (FraSCAti), considering different versions of its architecture. We report on our experience in this context.  },

  abstract = { Feature Models (FMs) are used extensively in software product line engineering to help generate and validate individual product configurations and to provide support for domain analysis.  As FM construction can be tedious and time-consuming, researchers have previously developed techniques for extracting FMs from sets of formally specified individual configurations, or from software requirements specifications for families of existing products.  However, such artifacts are often not available. In this paper we present a novel, automated approach for constructing FMs from publicly available product descriptions found in online product repositories and marketing websites such as SoftPedia and CNET.  While each individual product description provides only a partial view of features in the domain, a large set of descriptions can provide fairly comprehensive coverage. Our approach utilizes hundreds of partial product descriptions to construct an FM and is described and evaluated against antivirus product descriptions mined from SoftPedia. },

  abstract = {Nowadays, mass customization has been embraced by a large portion of the industry. As a result, the web abounds with sales config- urators that help customers tailor all kinds of goods and services to their specific needs. In many cases, configurators have become the sin- gle entry point for placing customer orders. As such, they are strategic components of companies' information systems and must meet stringent reliability, usability and evolvability requirements. However, the state of the art lacks guidelines and tools for efficiently engineering web sales configurators. To tackle this problem, empirical data on current practice is required. The first part of this paper reports on a systematic study of 111 web sales configurators along three essential dimensions: rendering of configuration options, constraint handling, and configuration process support. Based on this, the second part highlights good and bad prac- tices in engineering web sales configurator. The reported quantitative and qualitative results open avenues for the elaboration of methodolo- gies to (re-)engineer web sales configurators.},

	abstract = {In Software Product Lines (SPLs), a feature model can be used to represent the similarities and differences within a family of software systems. This allows describing the systems derived from the product line as a unique combination of the features in the model. What makes feature models particularly appealing is the fact that the constraints in the model prevent incompatible features from being part of the same product. Despite the benefits of feature models, constructing and maintaining these models can be a laborious task especially in product lines with a large number of features and constraints. As a result, the study of automated techniques to reason on feature models has become an important research topic in the SPL community in recent years. Two techniques, in particular, have significant appeal for researchers: SAT solvers and Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs). Each technique has been applied successfully for over four decades now to tackle many practical combinatorial problems in various domains. Currently, several approaches have proposed the compilation of feature models to specific logic representations to enable the use of SAT solvers and BDDs. In this thesis, we argue that several critical issues related to the use of SAT solvers and BDDs have been consistently neglected. For instance, satisfiability is a well-known NP-complete problem which means that, in theory, a SAT solver might be unable to check the satisfiability of a feature model in a feasible amount of time. Similarly, it is widely known that the size of BDDs can become intractable for large models. At the same time, we currently do not know precisely whether these are real issues when feature models, especially large ones, are compiled to SAT and BDD representations. Therefore, in our research we provide a significant step forward in the state-of-the-art by examining deeply many relevant properties of the feature modeling domain and the mechanics of SAT solvers and BDDs and the sensitive issues related to these techniques when applied in that domain. Specifically, we provide more accurate explanations for the space and/or time (in)tractability of these techniques in the feature modeling domain, and enhance the algorithmic performance of these techniques for reasoning on feature models. The contributions of our work include the proposal of novel heuristics to reduce the size of BDDs compiled from feature models, several insights on the construction of efficient domain-specific reasoning algorithms for feature models, and empirical studies to evaluate the efficiency of SAT solvers in handling very large feature models.},

Unfortunately, the task of creating a feature model for an existing project is both daunting and time-consuming, requiring substantial effort from a modeler.
We present procedures for reverse engineering feature models, based on a crucial heuristic for identifying parents---the major challenge of this task. We also automatically recover constructs such as feature groups, mandatory features, and implies/exclude edges. We evaluate the technique on two large-scale software product lines with existing reference feature models---the Linux and eCos kernels---and FreeBSD, a project without a feature model. Our heuristic is effective across all three projects. It ranks the correct parent among the top results for vast majority of features.  We effectively reduce the information a modeler has to consider from thousands of choices to typically five or less.},

Feature models are a popular formalism for managing variability in software product lines (SPLs). In practice, developing an SPL can involve modeling a large number of features representing different viewpoints, sub-systems or concerns of the software system.  
To manage complexity, there is a need to separate, relate and compose
several feature models while automating the reasoning on their
compositions in order to enable rigorous SPL validation and configuration.
In this paper, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that is dedicated
to the management of feature models and that complements existing tool support.
Rationale for this language is discussed and its main constructs are
presented through examples. We show how the DSL can be
used to realize a non trivial scenario in which multiple SPLs are managed.

  ABSTRACT = {
A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or detect specific feature combinations for testing. 
However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for product variants leads to incorrect results.
We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas to reason about program variants. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing.

abstract={Embedded systems such as automotive systems are very complex to specify. Since it is difficult to capture all their requirements or their design in one single model, approaches working with several system views are adopted. The main problem there is to keep these views coherent; the issue is known as view reconciliation. This paper proposes an algebraic solution. It uses sets of integration constraints that link (families of) system features in one view to other (families of) features in the same or a different view. Both, families and constraints, are formalised using a feature algebra. Besides presenting a constraint relation and its mathematical properties, the paper shows in several examples the suitability of this approach for a wide class of integration constraint formulations.},

abstract={ In requirements elicitation, different stakeholders often hold different views of how a proposed system should behave, resulting in inconsistencies between their descriptions. Consensus may not be needed for every detail, but it can be hard to determine whether a particular disagreement affects the critical properties of the system. We describe the Xbel framework for merging and reasoning about multiple, inconsistent state machine models. Xbel permits the analyst to choose how to combine information from the multiple viewpoints, where each viewpoint is described using an underlying multi-valued logic. The different values of our logics typically represent different levels of agreement. Our multi-valued model checker, Xchek, allows us to check the merged model against properties expressed in a temporal logic. The resulting framework can be used as an exploration tool to support requirements negotiation, by determining what properties are preserved for various combinations of inconsistent viewpoints.},

   abstract = {While it is acknowledged that system requirements will never be complete, incompleteness is often due to an inadequate process and methods for acquiring and tracking a representative set of requirements. Viewpoint development has been proposed to address these problems. We offer a viewpoint development approach that fits easily into the current practice of capturing requirements as use case descriptions. However, current practice does not support visualization of use case descriptions, the capture of multiple use case descriptions, the modeling of conflicts and the reconciliation of viewpoints. In our approach we apply techniques from natural language processing, term subsumption and set-theory to automatically convert the use case descriptions into a line diagram. The visualisation of use case descriptions is a natural addition to the object-oriented design of systems using the Unified Modelling Language where diagrams act as communication and validation devices. RECOCASE is a comprehensive methodology that includes use case description guidelines, a controlled language to support natural language translation, a requirements engineering process model and a tool to assist the specification and reconciliation of requirements. Our approach combines group and individual processes to minimise contradictions and missing information and maximise ownership of the requirements models. In this paper we describe each of the parts of our methodology following an example through each section.},

In this paper, we propose a cardinality-based notation for feature modeling, which integrates a number of existing extensions of previous approaches. We then introduce and motivate the novel concept of staged configuration. Staged configuration can be achieved by the stepwise specialization of feature models. This is important because in a realistic development process, different groups and different people eliminate product variability in different stages. We also indicate how cardinality-based feature models and their specialization can be given a precise formal semantics.},

Furthermore, we identify a set of facilities based on constraint satisfaction that can be provided by feature modeling and feature-based configuration tools and present a prototype implementing some of these facilities. We report on our experience with the prototype and give directions for future work.},

	title = {What's in a Feature : A Requirements Engineering Perspective},
	abstract = {The notion of feature is heavily used in Software Engineering, especially for software product lines. However, this notion
appears to be confusing, mixing various aspects of problem and solution. In this paper, we attempt to clarify the notion of
feature in the light of Zave and Jackson's framework for Requirements Engineering. By redefining a problem-level feature as a set
of related requirements, specifications and domain assumptions-the three types of statements central to Zave and Jackson's
framework-we also revisit the notion of feature interaction. This clarification work opens new perspectives on formal description
and verification of software product lines. An important benefit of the approach is to enable an early identification of feature
interactions taking place in the systems' environment, a notoriously challenging problem. The approach is illustrated through
a proof-of-concept prototype tool and applied to a Smart Home example.

	Abstract = {If we model a family of software applications with a feature model and an architecture model, we are describing the same subject from different perspectives. Hence, we are running the risk of inconsistencies. For instance, the feature model might allow feature configurations that are not realizable by the architecture.  In this paper we tackle this problem by providing a formalization of dependencies between features and components. Further, we demonstrate that this formalization offers a better understanding of the modeled concepts. Moreover, we propose automated techniques that derive additional information and provide feedback to the user. Finally, we discuss how some of these techniques can be implemented.   },

  abstract = {Feature Models (FMs) are a popular formalism for modelling and reasoning about commonality and variability of a system. In essence, FMs aim to define a set of valid combinations of features, also called configurations. In this paper, we tackle the problem of synthesising an FM from a set of configurations. The main challenge is that numerous candidate FMs can be extracted from the same input configurations, yet only a few of them are meaningful and maintainable. We first characterise the different meanings of FMs and identify the key properties allowing to discriminate between them. We then develop a generic synthesis procedure capable of restituting the intended meanings of FMs based on inferred or user-specified knowledge. Using tool support, we show how the integration of knowledge into FM synthesis can be realized in different practical application scenarios that involve reverse engineering and maintaining FMs.},

In this paper, we focus on the UML metaconcepts of classes and objects from an ontological point of view. We use a philosophically and psychologically well-founded theory of classifiers to propose a UML profile for Ontology Representation and Conceptual Modeling. Moreover, we propose a design pattern based on this profile to target a recurrent problem in role modeling discussed in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the relevance of the tools proposed by applying them to solve recurrent problems in the practice of conceptual modeling.},

@article{bachmeyer2008,
	Abstract = {A software product-line is a set of products built from a core set of software components. Although software engineers develop software product-lines for various application types, they are most commonly used for embedded systems development, where the variability of hardware features requires variability in the supporting firmware. Feature models are used to represent the variability in these software product-lines. Various feature modeling approaches have been proposed, including feature diagrams, domain specific languages, constraint languages, and the semantic web language OWL. This paper explores a conceptual graph approach to feature modeling in an effort to produce feature models that have a more natural, and more easily expressed mapping to the problem domain. It demonstrates the approach using a standard Graph Product-line problem that has been discussed in various software product-line papers. A conceptual graph feature model is developed for the graph product-line and it is compared to other feature models for this product-line. },

It is supported by Alloy Analyzer, a tool, which allows fully automated analysis. As a result, creating Alloy code from a UML model provides the opportunity to exploit analysis capabilities of the Alloy Analyzer to discover possible design flaws at early stages of the software development. Our research makes use of model based techniques for the automated transformation of UML class diagrams with OCL constraints to Alloy code. The paper demonstrates challenging aspects of the model transformation, which originate in fundamental differences between UML and Alloy. We shall discuss some of the differences and illustrate their implications on the model transformation process. The presented approach is explained via an example of a secure e-business system. },

	Abstract = {Feature models have been widely adopted in domain requirements capturing and specifying. However, there are still difficulties remaining in domain model validating and application-oriented tailoring. These difficulties are partly due to the missing of a strictly defined feature meta-model, which makes it difficult to formally represent the feature models. Aiming at the problem, we propose an ontology-based feature modeling method supporting application-oriented tailoring. In this method features are classified into several categories and are all precisely defined in the OWL-based meta-model. Expression capacity of the feature model can be greatly improved due to the rich types of features. On the other hand the feature model can be easily converted into ontology model and be validated through ontology inference. Application-oriented tailoring can also gain support from the reasoning-based guidance. Finally, advantages of ontology-based feature modeling, especially for component and architecture design, are discussed with our conclusions. },

	Abstract = {This paper describes a feature modelling technique aimed at modelling the software assets behind a product family. The proposed technique is distinctive in five respects. First, it proposes a feature meta-model that avoids the need for model normalization found in other meta-models. Second, it uses an XSL-based mechanism to express complex composition rules for the features. Third, it offers a means to decompose large feature diagrams into extensible and self-contained modules. Fourth, it defines an XML-based approach to expressing the feature models that offers a low-cost path to the development of support tools for building the models. Fifth, it explicitly supports both the modelling of the product family and of the applications instantiated from it. The paper presents the feature modelling technique in the context of an on-going project to build a generative environment for family instantiation. The experience from two cases studies is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Product family engineering consists of several activities commonly separated into the areas of domain engineering and product engineering. The main part of product engineering is the definition of product decisions, which means in the context of feature modeling that for each feature the product engineer has to define in what products it will be included. In the automotive domain --and probably in many other embedded real-time domains as well --the considerations that influence these feature selections are extremely complex and, at the same time, need to be documented as closely as possible for later reference. In this paper, we (1) present a detailed description of this problem and (2) try to show that existing approaches do not sufficiently meet these concerns. We then (3) provide a detailed definition of product sets as a means to solve the problem and (4) show what methodological implications arise from the use of this concept.},

	Abstract = {The feature model is a domain/product-line oriented requirements model based on hierarchical structure and explicit variability modeling, and has been adopted by several important software reuse methods. However, with respect to the problem of verification of constraints on features and verification of partially customized feature models, these methods tend to be semi-formal and offer little formal assistance. In this paper, we propose a propositional logic-based method for the verification of feature models at different binding times. The most important characteristic of this method is that it integrates the logical verification with binding times, which makes it can be used to verify any partially customized feature models at any binding time (except run-time). In this method, constraints on features are formalized by logical sentences. Thus, the verification of feature models is converted into satisfaction problems in the logic. With this formal method, verification problems such as the detection of inconsistent constraints or the detection of conflicting or unnecessary binding resolutions can be automatically revealed.},

	abstract = {Feature diagrams are a popular means for documenting variability in software product line engineering. When examining feature diagrams in the literature and from industry, we observed that the same modelling concepts are used for documenting two different kinds of variability: (1) product line variability, which reflects decisions of product management on how the systems that belong to the product line should vary, and (2) software variability, which reflects the ability of the reusable product line artefacts to be customized or configured. To disambiguate the documentation of variability, we follow previous suggestions to relate orthogonal variability models (OVMs) to feature diagrams. This paper reuses an existing formalization of feature diagrams, but introduces a formalization of OVMs. Then, the relationships between the two kinds of models are formalized as well. Besides a precise definition of the languages and the links, the important benefit of this formalization is that it serves as a foundation for a tool supporting automated reasoning on variability. This tool can, e.g., analyse whether the product line artefacts are flexible enough to build all the systems that should belong to the product line.},

	Abstract = {Product line software engineering (PLSE) is an emerging software engineering paradigm, which guides organizations toward the development of products from core assets rather than the development of products one by one from scratch. In order to develop highly reusable core assets, PLSE must have the ability to exploit commonality and manage variability among products from a domain perspective. Feature modeling is one of the most popular domain analysis techniques, which analyzes commonality and variability in a domain to develop highly reusable core assets for a product line. Various attempts have been made to extend and apply it to the development of software product lines. However, feature modeling can be difficult and time-consuming without a precise understanding of the goals of feature modeling and the aid of practical guidelines. In this paper, we clarify the concept of features and the goals of feature modeling, and provide practical guidelines for successful product line software engineering. The authors have extensively used feature modeling in several industrial product line projects and the guidelines described in this paper are based on these experiences. },

	Abstract = {Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM) approaches propose to model reusable aspects that can be applied to different systems at the model level. To improve reusability, several contributions have pointed out the needs of variability in the AOM approaches. Nevertheless, the support of variability makes the aspect design more complex and the introduction of several dimensions of variability (advice, pointcut and weaving) creates a combinatorial explosion of variants and a risk of inconsistency in the aspect model. As the integration of an aspect model may be a complex task, the AOM framework has to be a support for the designer to ensure the consistency of the resulting model. This paper presents an approach describing how to ensure that an aspect model with variability can be safely integrated into an existing model. Verification includes static checking of aspect model consistency and dynamic checking through testing with a focus on the parts of the model that are impacted by the aspect. },

	Abstract = {Variability is a central concept in software product family development. Variability empowers constructive reuse and facilitates the derivation of different, customer specific products from the product family. If many customer specific requirements can be realised by exploiting the product family variability, the reuse achieved is obviously high. If not, the reuse is low. It is thus important that the variability of the product family is adequately considered when eliciting requirements from the customer. In this paper we sketch the challenges for requirements engineering for product family applications. More precisely we elaborate on the need to communicate the variability of the product family to the customer. We differentiate between variability aspects which are essential for the customer and aspects which are more related to the technical realisation and need thus not be communicated to the customer. Motivated by the successful usage of use cases in single product development we propose use cases as communication medium for the product family variability. We discuss and illustrate which customer relevant variability aspects can be represented with use cases, and for which aspects use cases are not suitable. Moreover we propose extensions to use case diagrams to support an intuitive representation of customer relevant variability aspects.},

	Abstract = {Semantic Web (SW), commonly regarded as the next generation of the Web, is an emerging vision of the new Web from the Knowledge Representation and the Web communities. The Formal Methods community can also play an important role to contribute to SW development. Reasoning and consistency checking can be useful at many stages during the design, maintenance and deployment of SW ontology. However the existing reasoning and consistency checking tools for SW are primitive. We believe that formal techniques and tools, such as Alloy, can provide automatic reasoning and consistency checking services for SW. In this paper, we firstly construct semantic models for the SW language (DAML+OIL) in Alloy, and these models form the semantic domain for interpreting DAML+OIL in Alloy. Then we develop the translation techniques and tools which can automatically map the SW ontology into the DAML+OIL semantic domain in Alloy. Furthermore, with the assistance of Alloy Analyzer (AA) we demonstrate that the consistency of the SW ontology can be checked automatically and different kinds of reasoning tasks can be supported.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a kind of semantics for constraints in clone-enabled feature models, which resolves the problem of what kinds of constraint should be added to a feature model after some features are cloned. The semantics is composed of two patterns: the generating pattern and the adapting pattern, to address the two problems of what kind of constraints should be imposed on a clonable feature and its clones, and how an existing constraint should be transformed in the context that features involved in the constraint are cloned, respectively. After that, we propose a BDD-based approach to verifying clone-enabled feature models, an approach that makes efficient use of the BDD (binary decision diagram) data structures, by considering the specific characteristics of feature models' verification. Experiments show that this BDD-based approach is more efficient and can verify more complex feature models than our previous method. },

	title = {FORM: A feature-oriented reuse method with domain-specific reference architectures},
	volume = {5},
	abstract = {Abstract  Systematic discovery and exploitation of commonality across related software systems is a fundamental technical requirement for achieving successful software reuse. By examining a class/family of related systems and the commonality underlying those systems, it is possible to obtain a set of reference models, i.e., software architectures and components needed for implementing applications in the class. FORM (Feature-;Oriented Reuse Method) supports development of such reusable architectures and components (through a process called the "domain engineering" and development of applications using the domain artifacts produced from the domain engineering. FORM starts with an analysis of commonality among applications in a particular domain in terms of services, operating environments, domain technologies, and implementation techniques. The model constructed during the analysis is called a "feature" model, and it captures commonality as an AND/OR graph, where AND nodes indicate mandatory features and OR nodes indicate alternative features selectable for different applications. Then, this model is used to define parameterized reference architectures and appropriate reusable components instantiatable during application development. Architectures are defined from three different viewpoints (subsystem, process, and module) and have intimate association with the features. The subsystem architecture is used to package service features and allocate them to different computers in a distributed environment. Each subsystem is further decomposed into processes considering the operating environment features. Modules are defined based on the features on domain technology and implementation techniques. These architecture models that represent an architecture at different levels of abstraction are derived from the feature hierarchy captured in the feature model. Modules serve as basis for creating reusable components, and their specification defines how they are integrated into the application (e.g., as-;is integration of pre-;coded component, instantiation of parameterized templates, and filling-;in skeletal codes). Our experiences have shown that for the electronic bulletin board and the private branch exchange (PBX) domains, "features" make up for a common domain language and the main communication medium among application users and developers. Thus, the feature model well represents a "decision space" of software development, and is a good starting point for identifying candidate reusable components. },

A software product line is a set of software products sharing a set of common features but containing variation points. Successful SPLE requires making selection decisions at variation points effectively and efficiently. A significant challenge is how to identify, represent and manage the inter-dependency of selection decisions for requirements. We developed the concept of a meta-model for requirement decision models to bring formalism and consistency to the structure and to model inter-dependencies between requirement selection decisions. Here we present a meta-model for requirement selection decisions that includes inter-dependencies and we use a mobile phone worked example to illustrate our approach. To support our method, we developed two separate tools, V-Define (for domain decision model construction) and V-Resolve (for new product derivation). Finally the results of a metal processing product line case study using the tools are described. },

The paper describes how to render a graph transformation system - specified using AGG - as an Alloy model and how to exploit its tools to prove significant properties of the system. Specifically, it allows the user to decide whether a given configuration (graph) can be obtained through a finite and bounded sequence of steps (invocation of rules), whether a given sequence of rules can be applied on an initial graph, and, given an initial graph and an integer n, which are the configurations that can be obtained by applying a sequence of n (particular) rules. },

Attribute Grammars are the specification language of many tools that automatically generate programming language implementations. We consider the problem of verifying properties of attribute grammar specifications, particularly properties that are not well supported by existing tools. Rather than propose methods for extending existing tool implementation techniques, we propose the use of off-the-shelf formal methods tools as the basis for attribute grammar verification. Off-the-shelf tools can provide significant expressive power at a much lower cost than extending an existing evaluator generator. As a specific example, we describe how to use the Alloy model finding and checking tool to verify properties of remote attribution constructs in the {LIDO} attribute grammar specification language. A naive application of this approach has significant performance overheads; we discuss techniques for limiting the scope of the problems that are solved to make the approach tractable.},

Features express the variabilities and commonalities among programs 
in a software product line (SPL). A feature model defines 
the valid combinations of features, where each combination 
corresponds to a program in an SPL. SPLs and their feature 
models evolve over time. We classify the evolution of a feature 
model via modifications as refactorings, specializations, 
generalizations, or arbitrary edits. We present an algorithm 
to reason about feature model edits to help designers determine 
how the program membership of an SPL has changed. Our algorithm 
takes two feature models as input (before and after edit versions), 
where the set of features in both models are not necessarily the 
same, and it determines the change classification. Our algorithm 
efficiently determines classifications of edits to models that 
have hundreds or thousands of features.

	abstract = {In <i>Software Abstractions</i> Daniel Jackson introduces a new approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach--which Jackson calls "lightweight formal methods" or "agile modeling"--takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. The designer can use automated analysis not only to correct errors but also to make models that are more precise and elegant. This approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from "the tarpit of implementation technologies" and return them to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. <br /> <br /> <i>Software Abstractions</i> introduces the key elements of the approach: a logic, which provides the building blocks of the language; a language, which adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of constraint solving that offers both simulation (generating sample states and executions) and checking (finding counterexamples to claimed properties). The book uses Alloy as a vehicle because of its simplicity and tool support, but the book's lessons are mostly language-independent, and could also be applied in the context of other modeling languages.},

from the legacy product line assets. Reorganizing the product line assets with respect to new requirements requires more knowledge
than what is easily provided by the classical feature-modeling approaches. Hence, adding all the feature dependencies and
interactions into the feature tree results in unreadable and unmanageable feature models that fail to achieve their original
goals.

We therefore propose two complementary views to represent the feature model. One view shows the hierarchical refinement of
features similar to common feature-modeling approaches in a feature tree. The second view describes what kind of dependencies
and interactions there are between various features.



We show two examples of feature dependencies and interactions in the context of an engine-control software product line, and
we demonstrate how our approach helps to define correct product configurations from product line variants.

To represent assets belonging to the core of the family and assets belonging to variable parts, feature modeling is a widely used concept. Consistency checking in feature models is not yet addressed appropriately by current methods. The paper gives a brief overview of feature modeling and elaborates the problems of current approaches. Based on the applications of these approaches within an ongoing research project, the paper proposes a formalized definition for feature modeling using the Object Constraint Language {(OCL)} and a set of associations and constraints to be used in the feature model. The relations between features in the feature model and features to external assets are examined and a way to formally handle these relations is presented as a result of a research project.},

Several organizations that employ product families, however, are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that, despite the efforts in domain engineering, deriving individual products from their shared software assets is a time- and effort-consuming activity. In this paper, we present a collection of product derivation problems that we identified during a case study at two large and mature industrial organizations. These problems are attributed to the lack of methodological support for application engineering, and to underlying causes of complexity and implicit properties. For each problem, we provide a description and an example, while for each cause we present a description, consequences, solutions, and research issues. The discussions in this paper are relevant outside the context of the two companies, as the challenges they face arise in, for example, comparable or less mature organizations.},

	abstract = {Abstract  There is a large conceptual gap between end-to-end infrastructure requirements and detailed component configuration implementing
those requirements. Today, this gap is manually bridged so large numbers of configuration errors are made. Their adverse effects
on infrastructure security, availability, and cost of ownership are well documented. This paper presents {ConfigAssure} to help
automatically bridge the above gap. It proposes solutions to four fundamental problems: specification, configuration synthesis,
configuration error diagnosis, and configuration error repair. Central to {ConfigAssure} is a Requirement Solver. It takes as
input a configuration database containing variables, and a requirement as a first-order logic constraint in finite domains.
The Solver tries to compute as output, values for variables that make the requirement true of the database when instantiated
with these values. If unable to do so, it computes a proof of unsolvability. The Requirement Solver is used in different ways
to solve the above problems. The Requirement Solver is implemented with Kodkod, a {SAT-based} model finder for first-order logic.
While any requirement can be directly encoded in Kodkod, parts of it can often be solved much more efficiently by non model-finding
methods using information available in the configuration database. Solving these parts and simplifying can yield a reduced
constraint that truly requires the power of model-finding. To implement this plan, a quantifier-free form, {QFF,} is defined.
A {QFF} is a Boolean combination of simple arithmetic constraints on integers. A requirement is specified by defining a partial
evaluator that transforms it into an equivalent {QFF.} This {QFF} is efficiently solved by Kodkod. The partial evaluator is implemented
in Prolog. {ConfigAssure} is shown to be natural and scalable in the context of a realistic, secure and fault-tolerant datacenter.

A feature-oriented approach to commonality and variability analysis (called feature modeling) has been used extensively for product line engineering. Feature modeling mainly focuses on identifying commonalities and variabilities among products of a product line and organizing them in terms of structural relationships (e.g., aggregation and generalization) and configuration dependencies (e.g., required and excluded). Although the structural relationships and configuration dependencies are essential inputs to product line asset development, they are not sufficient to develop reusable and adaptable product line assets. Other types of dependencies among features also have significant influences on the design of product line assets. In this paper, we extend the feature modeling to analyze feature dependencies that are useful in the design of reusable and adaptable product line components, and present design guidelines based on the extended model. An elevator control software example is used to illustrate the concept of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Effective product family based development depends on exploiting the commonality and variability in customer requirements. The desirability of variability in products is driven by the (manifest and hidden) needs of the various target market segments identified by various organizational units like sales and marketing. These are informed by other critical components of the context in which product families are developed including the technological capabilities, people/human resources available with the organization, the policies and procedures of the organization, and the strategic objective of the organization. Variability Management is seen as the key aspect that differentiates conventional software engineering and software product line engineering {[Kruger} 02]. Variability in a product family is defined as a measure of how members of a family may differ from each other {[WeissLai} 99]. Variability is made explicit using variation points. Variation points are places in design artifacts where a specific decision has been narrowed to several options but the option to be chosen for a particular system has been left open {[Atkinson} 01]. Identification of the points of variability is crucial in proliferating variety from a single product platform. A central component of product family approach is the management of variability. The product family development process involves managing variations among different members of the family by identifying common and variable aspects in the domain under consideration.},

an approach to configuration inspired by type inference technology. The main contributions of the paper are a formalization
of the configuration problem that includes aspects related to the interactive dialogue between the user and the system, a
result stating that the configuration problem thus formalized has at least exponential complexity, and some techniques for
computing approximate solutions more efficiently. While a substantial number of papers precede the present one in formalizing
configuration as a constraint satisfaction problem, few address the aspects concerning interactivity between the user and
the system.

	abstract = {Product line software engineering {(PLSE)} is an emerging software engineering paradigm, which guides organizations toward the
development of products from core assets rather than the development of products one by one from scratch. In order to develop
highly reusable core assets, {PLSE} must have the ability to exploit commonality and manage variability among products from
a domain perspective. Feature modeling is one of the most popular domain analysis techniques, which analyzes commonality and
variability in a domain to develop highly reusable core assets for a product line. Various attempts have been made to extend
and apply it to the development of software product lines. However, feature modeling can be difficult and time-consuming without
a precise understanding of the goals of feature modeling and the aid of practical guidelines. In this paper, we clarify the
concept of features and the goals of feature modeling, and provide practical guidelines for successful product line software
engineering. The authors have extensively used feature modeling in several industrial product line projects and the guidelines
described in this paper are based on these experiences.

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11554844_6},
	abstract = {Home service robots have a wide range of potential applications, such as home security, patient caring, cleaning, etc. The services provided by the robots in each application area are being defined as markets are formed and, therefore, they change constantly. Thus, robot applications need to evolve both quickly and flexibly adopting frequently changing requirements. This makes software product line framework ideal for the domain of home service robots. Unfortunately, however, robot manufacturers often focus on developing technical components (e.g., vision recognizer and speech processor) and then attempt to develop robots by integrating these components in an ad-hoc way. This practice produces robot applications that are hard to re-use and evolve when requirements change. We believe that re-engineering legacy robot applications into product line assets can significantly enhance reusability and evolvability. In this paper, we present our experience of re-engineering legacy home service robot applications into product line assets through feature modeling and analysis. First, through reverse engineering, we recovered architectures and components of the legacy applications. Second, based on the recovered information and domain knowledge, we reconstructed a feature model for the legacy applications. Anticipating changes in business opportunities or technologies, we restructured and refined the feature model to produce a feature model for the product line. Finally, based on the refined feature model and engineering principles we adopted for asset development, we designed a new architecture and components for robot applications.},

Moreover, feature binding information (i.e., when and how product features are included to products and delivered to customers) also drives product line component design. Feature binding can be examined from three perspectives: what features are bound (feature binding unit), when features are bound (feature binding time), and how features are bound (feature binding techniques), and this information must be made available to component design so that composition of components for feature binding becomes feasible. In this paper, we introduce an approach to analyzing feature binding from the three perspectives (i.e., what, when, and how) and illustrate how the analysis results can be used for component development of a product line.},

Recently, there have been efforts to address issues related to production planning, most of which focus on the process and business/management aspects of production planning; not much emphasis is given to technical issues such as deciding which features will be made as core assets and what their granularity will be. In this paper, we introduce a feature-based approach to product line production planning and illustrate how our approach addresses these technical issues. In our approach, a feature model and feature-binding information are used as primary input to production plan development. A product line production plan created using our approach could be customized easily to a product-specific production plan, because when we developed the approach, we considered units of product configurations as well as their integration techniques.},

Various implementation approaches for developing a domain-specific language are available in literature. There are certain common beliefs about the advantages/disadvantages of these approaches. However, it is hard to be objective and speak in favor of a particular one, since these implementation approaches are normally compared over diverse application domains.
The purpose of this paper is to provide empirical results from ten diverse implementation approaches for domain-specific languages, but conducted using the same representative language. Comparison shows that these discussed approaches differ in terms of the effort need to implement them, however, the effort needed by a programmer to implement a domain-specific language should not be the only factor taken into consideration. Another important factor is the effort needed by an end-user to rapidly write correct programs using the produced domain-specific language. Therefore, this paper also provides empirical results on end-user productivity, which is measured as the lines of code needed to express a domain-specific program, similarity to the original notation, and how error-reporting and debugging are supported in a given implementation.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that successful product line engineering revolves around the creation of a coherent and flexible
product line architecture that consolidates the common parts of a product family for reuse and captures the variant parts
for simple adaptation. However, it has been less clear what form such architectures should take and how they should be represented.
One promising approach is offered by the new {Model-Driven} Architecture {(MDA)} paradigm of the Object Management Group {(OMG).}
This paradigm holds that an organization's key architectural assets should be represented in an abstract "platform-independent"
way, in terms of Unified Modeling Language {(UML)} models, and thereby be shielded from the idiosyncrasies and volatility of
specific implementation technologies. In this paper, we discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in using the {MDA}
paradigm for product line engineering and explain how model-driven, product line architectures can be developed, maintained
and applied. After first outlining the core concepts of product line engineering and the ad hoc strategies currently used
to support it, the paper provides a detailed metamodel of the information that needs to be stored within a product line architecture.

	abstract = {{PLM} approaches are becoming a prominent approach in the Software Engineering and Systems Engineering {PL} contexts. The idea behind {PLM} is to focus on artifacts that are shared and that vary from one product to the other, so as to facilitate reuse and adaptation. Gains are expected in terms of time to market, consistency across products, easier identification of requirements for future products, costs reduction, better flexibility, and better management of change requirements. While most of the recent research works are focusing on methods and modeling techniques, little has been done so far with respect to {PLM} tools and their ability to answer industry needs. A study was thus undertaken in collaboration with a group of industrials to evaluate existing {PLM} tools. The purpose of the study was twofold: to understand the salient characteristics of {PLM} tools, and to evaluate the ability of existing tools to satisfy the expectations of industrials. The study was conducted using (a) a state of the art of {PLM} methods, (b) an analysis grid developed by the industrial partners to analyze the characteristics {ofPM} tools in general, and (c) interviews with our industrial partners. This paper reports our analysis under the form of a benchmark aimed at being used by industrials to select existing tools, and discusses open issues in the domain of {RE} for {PL.}},

	abstract = {Traceability links are generally recognised as helpful means for improving the effectiveness of evolutionary development processes.
However, their practical usage in analysis and design is still unsatisfying, especially due to the high effort required for
creation, maintenance and verification of the links, and due to lacking or missing methods and tools for their management.

In this paper a concept for the systematic management of traceability is introduced, adapted for the and integrated into the
Unified Process as one of the widely accepted software development methods. As an extension, requirements templates are applied
to facilitate a tool supported analysis of natural language texts in use case descriptions. Template-based analyses enable
a determination of types of terms and a check of their correct application as well as a recognition of implicit connections
between development artefacts. A rule set is defined as a first step towards a powerful support of traceability handling.
In the ongoing project the rule set is enhanced by heuristics and semantic-based rules to a whole framework of methods and
rules.

Due to the {PLs'} inherit complexity, many {PL} methods use the notion of "features" to support requirements analysis and domain modelling (e.g. {FODA,} {FORM,} {FeatuRSEB).} Nevertheless, the link between features and architecture remains weak in all methodologies, with a large impact on the traceability of high-level concerns in respect to lower-lever architectural structures. This paper provides an analysis on the state of the art of feature-oriented {PL} methodologies from the point of view of the linkage between feature models and architecture. Based on the identified shortcomings it introduces an approach to allow a strong mapping between features and architecture. The approach makes use of extensions in the feature modelling techniques and adopts plug-in architectures as a means of mapping feature structures and at the same time satisfying the demanded {PL} variability and flexibility.

	abstract = {Constructing and executing distributed systems that can adapt to their operating context in order to sustain provided services
and the service qualities are complex tasks. Managing adaptation of multiple, interacting services is particularly difficult
since these services tend to be distributed across the system, interdependent and sometimes tangled with other services. Furthermore,
the exponential growth of the number of potential system configurations derived from the variabilities of each service need
to be handled. Current practices of writing low-level reconfiguration scripts as part of the system code to handle run time
adaptation are both error prone and time consuming and make adaptive systems difficult to validate and evolve. In this paper,
we propose to combine model driven and aspect oriented techniques to better cope with the complexities of adaptive systems
construction and execution, and to handle the problem of exponential growth of the number of possible configurations. Combining
these techniques allows us to use high level domain abstractions, simplify the representation of variants and limit the problem
pertaining to the combinatorial explosion of possible configurations. In our approach we also use models at runtime to generate
the adaptation logic by comparing the current configuration of the system to a composed model representing the configuration
we want to reach.

derivation techniques, which strive to automate the derivation process, are inflexible in that they fail to accommodate products

support to assist product derivation in such cases. In this paper, we address flexibility issues by introducing an analysis
model, based on {UML,} {OCL} and use cases, that implicitly defines define product line variabilities and boundaries by means
of constraints forbidding undesired products. Then, in order to reuse domain assets in a coherent manner, an imperative model
transformation mechanism is devised. We illustrate this approach through a simple example.

paper is initiated by some of the challenges associated with modeling of products and product families in such companies.
For some of them, the situation is made extreme by market conditions, which imply long order horizons and many changes of
the orders both before and after order acceptance.

With focus on these challenges, an approach is described about modeling of product families on multiple abstraction levels
in a way where customer driven product configuration is concentrated on decisions, which are relatively invariant throughout
order processing. The approach, which is used here, is based on the theory of general systems and outlined in combination
with the abstraction mechanisms classification and composition together with object-oriented analysis and design. A generic
model component is presented for enabling representation of models as data models.

	abstract = {Product Derivation is one of the central activities in Software Product Lines {(SPL).} One of the main challenges of the process of product derivation is dealing with complexity, which is caused by the large number of artifacts and dependencies between them. Another major challenge is maximizing development efficiency and reducing time-to-market, while at the same time producing high quality products. One approach to overcome these challenges is to automate the derivation process. To this end, this paper focuses on one particular activity of the derivation process; the derivation of the product-specific architecture and describes how this activity can be automated using a model-driven approach. The approach derives the product-specific architecture by selectively copying elements from the product-line architecture. The decision, which elements are included in the derived architecture, is based on a product-specific feature configuration. We present a prototype that implements the derivation as a model transformation described in the Atlas Transformation Language {(ATL).} We conclude with a short overview of related work and directions for future research},

	abstract = {Model inconsistency management is a crucial aspect of model-driven software engineering. It is therefore important to provide
automated support for this activity. The problem is, however, that the resolution of inconsistencies may give rise to new
inconsistencies. To address this problem, we propose to express inconsistency detection and resolutions as graph transformation
rules, and to apply the theory of critical pair analysis to analyse potential dependencies between the detection and resolution
of model inconsistencies. As a proof-of-concept, we report on an experiment that we have carried out along these lines using
the critical pair analysis algorithm implemented in the state-of-the-art graph transformation tool {AGG.} The results show that both anticipated and unexpected dependencies between inconsistency detection and resolution rules
are found by {AGG.} We discuss how the integration of the proposed approach into contemporary modelling tools may improve inconsistency
management in various ways.

Moreover, through evolution those diagrams get modified leading to possible inconsistency between different versions of the diagrams. State-of-the-art {UML} {CASE} tools provide poor support for consistency maintenance. To solve this problem, an extension of the {UML} metamodel enabling support for consistency maintenance and a classification of inconsistency problems is proposed. To achieve the detection and resolution of consistency conflicts, the use of description logic {(DL)} is presented. {DL} has the important property of being a decidable fragment of first-order predicate logic. By means of a number of concrete experiments in Loom, we show the feasibility of using this formalism for the purpose of maintaining consistency between (evolving) {UML} models.},

	abstract = {Separation of Concerns is one of the software engineering design principles that is getting more attention from practitioners
and researchers in order to promote design and code reuse. Separation of Concerns {(SoC)} separates requirements such as synchronization
and scheduling from the core functionality. These requirements are often referred to as crosscutting-concerns. The implementation
of such requirements is scattered throughout the system, which results in the code-tangling problem. Aspect Oriented Programming
provides the user with the ability to modularize, and weave crosscutting-concerns in order to maximize code reusability and
solves the code-tangling problem. Weaving is the process of combining crosscutting concerns with the core functionality. Using
the {UML} to model and inter-weave these concerns is a craft that is hard to master due to the lack of formal modeling techniques
based on {SoC.} In this paper we present a formal design methodology to model the system's concerns based on aspect-orientation.

	abstract = {An important demand in {Model-Driven} Development is the simple and efficient expression of model patterns. Current approaches
tend to distinguish the language they use to express patterns from the one for modelling. Consequently, productivity is reduced
by dealing with a distinct new language, and new intermediate steps are introduced in order to support pattern-matching. In
this paper we propose a framework for expressing patterns as model-snippets. We present how model-snippets are specified upon concepts in a given domain (meta-model), and how we perform pattern-matching
with model-snippets, whatever the meta-model. We also provide an implementation which is well integrated with existing technologies,
such as Eclipse Modelling Framework.

It does not cover all types of basic concerns that the stakeholders communicate. These include beliefs, desires, intentions, and attitudes. In response, we propose a core ontology that covers these concerns and is grounded in sound conceptual foundations resting on a foundational ontology. The new core ontology for {RE} leads to a new formulation of the requirements problem that extends Zave and Jackson's formulation. We thereby establish new standards for what minimum information should be represented in {RE} languages and new criteria for determining whether {RE} has been successfully completed.},

A general account is given of the problem frames approach to the development of software-intensive systems, assuming that the reader is already familiar with its basic ideas. The approach is considered in the light of the long-standing aspiration of software developers to merit a place among practitioners of the established branches of engineering. Some of its principles are examined, and some comments offered on the range of its applicability. A view of the approach is suggested by an important account of engineering in the aeronautical industry: in particular, the problem classes captured by elementary problem frames are likened to those solved in established engineering branches by normal, rather than radical, design. The relative lack of specialisation in software development is identified as an important factor holding back the evolution of normal design practice in some areas.},

Development of complex products is performed in multi-project environment in which it is crucial to explore interdependencies and manage the uncertainty with the information exchange and the understanding of the context. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a dependence structure matrix and domain mapping matrix approach that enables the systematic identification of interdependencies and relations in a Multi-project environment. These approaches enables clarifications of assumptions, the tractability of dependencies, explores the information needed within and between different departments, projects and people. This creates a transparency and enables the synchronization of actions through transformation of information and exploration of assumptions within and between domains. The outcomes of this process are situational visibility creating direction and accountability and the learning that takes place through communicating, reflecting, understanding, and acting.},

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-76811-1_9},
	abstract = {Handling the various derivations of an aspect-oriented software family architecture can be a daunting and costly task if explicit
support is not systematically provided throughout early and late development stages. Aspect-oriented software development
{(AOSD)} has been recently explored as a technique that enables software product line customization. However, the application
of {AOSD} has been limited to modularize specific crosscutting features encountered in the implementation of software product-line
architectures or frameworks. Only a few works have investigated the development of product derivation approaches for {AOSD.}
This paper presents a model-based generative approach to mapping features to aspects across different artifacts of a product
line. Our main aim is to enable the smooth and systematic derivation of aspect-oriented software family architecture. Our
approach is complementary to a set of previously-proposed modularization guidelines to implement aspect-oriented frameworks.
We present details about the suite of mappings supported by our generative model, illustrate them in heterogeneous case studies,
and discuss several implementation issues for its accomplishment.

graph transformations to specify and compose aspects. Graph transformations provide a unified approach for aspect modeling.
The methods presented here can be applied to any modeling language with a well-defined metamodel. This paper, however, focuses
on {UML} class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state diagrams. {MATA} takes a different approach to aspect-oriented modeling since
there are no explicit join points. Rather, any model element can be a join point and composition is a special case of model
transformation. We illustrate {MATA} on structural and behavioral models for a cell phone example.

	url = {http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-75162-5_7},
	abstract = {Handling aspects within models looks promising for managing crosscutting concerns early in the software life-cycle, up from
programming to design, analysis and even requirements. At the modeling level, even complex behavioral aspects can easily be
described for instance as pairs of sequence diagrams: one for the pointcut specifying the behavior to detect, and the second
one for an advice representing the wanted behavior at the join point. While this is fine for informal documentation purposes,
or even intuitive enough when a single aspect has to be woven, a more precise semantics of both join point detection and advice
weaving is needed for using these modeling artifacts for Model Driven Engineering activities such as code generation or test
synthesis. This paper proposes various interpretations for pointcuts that allow multiple behavioral aspects to be statically
woven. The idea is to allow join points to match a pointcut even when some extra-messages occur in between. However, with
this new way of specifying join points, the composition of the advice with the detected part cannot any longer be just a replacement
of the detected part by the advice. We have to consider the events (or the messages) of the join point, but also the events
which occur between them, and merge them with the behavior specified within the advice. We thus also propose a formal definition
of a new merge operator, and describe its implementation on the Kermeta platform.

	classes, model-driven development uses models, as graphs of interconnected

	for model transformation and for general programming using models.
	Many of these use single-object approaches to typing, derived from
	solutions found in object-oriented systems, while others use metamodels
	asmodel types, but without a clear notion of polymorphism. Both of
	these approaches lead to brittle and overly restrictive reuse characteristics.
	In this paper we propose a simple extension to object-oriented typing
	to better cater for a model-oriented context, including a simple
	strategy for typing models as a collection of interconnected objects.
	We suggest extensions to existing type system formalisms to support
	these concepts and theirmanipulation. Using a simple examplewe show
	how this extended approach permits more flexible reuse, while preserving

	abstract = {The goal of a Software Product Line {(SPL)} is to provide a set of reusable software assets for the rapid production of a software
systems family aimed at a specific market segment. The main objective of {SPL} engineering is to construct, as automatically
as possible, specific products after selecting the particular set of features that must be included in them. Unlike traditional
engineering of single systems, {SPL} engineering often requires dealing with three different languages at each stage of the
software lifecycle: (1) a language for specifying the variability of the {SPL} (e.g. a feature model); (2) a language for designing
the reusable software assets (e.g. {UML} 2.0); and (3) a language that specifies how these reusable assets must be composed
for constructing specific products. There are currently available enough languages for variability specification and software
assets design, but there is a general lack of languages for specifying and automating the composition of these assets. This
paper presents as a novel contribution a process to engineer this kind of language. The process produces an editor and a ÔøΩcompilerÔøΩ,
which automates the composition of reusable assets, for a particular language. To explain this process a language has been
developed to compose reusable assets of architectural models.

	abstract = {The software product-line approach (for software product families) is one of the success stories of software reuse. When applied, it can result in cost savings and increases in productivity. In addition, in safety-critical systems the approach has the potential for reuse of analysis and testing results, which can lead to a safer system. Nevertheless, there are times when it seems like a product family approach should work when, in fact, there are difficulties in properly defining the boundaries of the product family. In this paper, we draw on our experiences in applying the software product-line approach to a family of mobile robots, a family of flight guidance systems, and a family of cardiac pacemakers, as well as case studies done by others to (1) illustrate how domain structure can currently limit applicability of product-line approaches to certain domains and (2) demonstrate our progress towards a solution using a set-theoretic approach to reason about domains of what we call n-dimensional and hierarchical product families.},

  ABSTRACT = {Software product line is a paradigm to develop a family
of software products with the goal of reuse. In this paper, we
focus on a scenario in which different products from different
product lines are combined together in a third product
line to yield more elaborate products, i.e., a product line
consumes products from third product line suppliers. The
issue is not how different products can be produced separately,
but how they can be combined together. We propose
a service-oriented architecture where product lines are regarded
as services, yielding a service-oriented product line.
This paper illustrates the approach with an example for a
service-oriented architecture of a web portal product line
supplied by portlet product lines.

In order to maximize the reusability of services, a set of constraints (e.g., dependency and mutual exclusion constraints) among non-functional requirements tend to be complicated to maintain. Currently, those non-functional constraints are informally specified in natural languages, and developers need to ensure that their applications satisfy the constraints in manual and ad-hoc manners. This paper proposes a model-driven development framework, through the notion of feature modeling, to explicitly and graphically specify non-functional constraints in {SOA.} The proposed framework allows developers to validate non-functional constraints in their applications in an automatic and consistent way. This paper also describes how the proposed framework is implemented and effectively used for service-oriented application development.},

Many recent proposals such as the Business Process Modeling Language {(BPML)} and the Business Process Execution Language for Web Services {(BPEL4WS)} focus on combining existing web services into more sophisticated web services.

provide means for a well-modularized specification of crosscutting concerns such as logging, persistence, auditing, and security.
They also do not support the dynamic adaptation of composition at runtime. In this paper, we advocate an aspect-oriented approach

illustrate through examples how {AO4BPEL} makes the composition specification more modular and the composition itself more flexible

	abstract = {In order to deliver services that realize their requirements at low cost, in short time, and with high quality, service engineers
reuse existing services for building composite services. For each service that is part of such a composite service and which
is offered by a service provider, a service level agreement has to be established and the quality of service has to be monitored.
Therefore, in order to keep service management controllable, the overall number of services across all service compositions
that are maintained by an organization should be as small as possible. However, currently there exists no technique that would
support service engineers in selecting such a minimal set of services when building composite services. By drawing on research
results from software product line engineering, we define a service selection process {(SeVAR)} that exploits the similarities
in the requirements in order to select the minimal set of services that achieves the best coverage of those requirements.

	abstract = {In the context of Model Engineering, work has focused on operations such as model validation and model transformation. By
contrast, other model management operations of significant importance remain underdeveloped. One of the least elaborated operations
is model merging. In this paper we discuss the special requirements of model merging and introduce the Epsilon Merging Language {(EML),} a rule-based
language, with tool support, for merging models of diverse metamodels and technologies. Moreover, we identify special cases
of model merging that are of particular interest and provide a working example through which we demonstrate the practicality
and usefulness of the proposed language.

	url = {http://www.springerlink.com/content/wtm1tggmn2ma5y5u},
	abstract = {{AGG} is a general development environment for algebraic graph transformation systems which follows the interpretative approach. Its special power comes from a very flexible attribution concept. {AGG} graphs are allowed to be attributed by any kind of Java objects. Graph transformations can be equipped with arbitrary computations on these Java objects described by a Java expression. The {AGG} environment consists of a graphical user interface comprising several visual editors, an interpreter, and a set of validation tools. The interpreter allows the stepwise transformation of graphs as well as rule applications as long as possible. {AGG} supports several kinds of validations which comprise graph parsing, consistency checking of graphs and conflict detection in concurrent transformations by critical pair analysis of graph rules. Applications of {AGG} include graph and rule-based modeling of software, validation of system properties by assigning a graph transformation based semantics to some system model, graph transformation based evolution of software, and the definition of visual languages based on graph grammars.},

the details of services that communicate using Windows Communication Foundation {(WCF).} From definitions of the data contracts
between clients and servers, {WCF/C\#} code for service plumbing is generated. We conducted a survey amongst developers that
use this {DSL} while developing applications for customers. The {DSL} has been used in about 30 projects all around the world.

We describe the known success factors of the use of {DSLs,} such as improved maintainability and ease of re-use, and assert
how well this {DSL} scores on all of them. The analysis of the results of this case study also shows which conditions should
be fulfilled in order to increase the chances of success in using a {DSL} in a real life case.},
